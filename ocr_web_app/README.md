# OCR Web App

This is a simple Flask-based web application that lets you upload an image and extracts text from it using Tesseract OCR.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

Open your browser at `http://localhost:5000` and upload an image to see the extracted text.
